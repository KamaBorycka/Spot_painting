### Simulation of Hirst's Spot Painting using Python Turtle 

The Spot Painting are a series of artworks by British artist Damien Hirst.

Using `cologram.py` it was possible to extract 6 different colors from each image. In order to maintain color diversity, colors were obtained from three different images. The painting was created using a precise and systematic process thanks to `turtle.py`.

In order to run this code, run `python3 spot_project.py`
